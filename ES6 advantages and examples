Give an example of an Arrow function in ES6? List down its advantages.
answer:
a.We may use arrow function syntax with our method associated with the array, like map(), reduce(), filter() 
since by using arrow function syntax instead of using normal function syntax one could easily read and understand as well as write the code more effectively.
b.If we may use arrow functions while declaring promises and callbacks then it would be much easier
for any user to understand the concept behind them otherwise by using traditional function syntax concepts
like callback hells, promise chaining would eventually become more difficult to 
understand, or even writing would become a little complex.
